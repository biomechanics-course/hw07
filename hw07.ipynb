    "1. The Matlab file `runshotput.m` runs a simulation of the shotput\n",
    "using Alexander\\'s model. It is designed to study the observation that\n",
    "shotputters tend to activate their lower extremity muscles first,\n",
    "followed by upper extremity muscles, with delay parameter `tdelay`.\n",
    "<img src=\"shotput.png\" align=\"right\" width=\"20%\"/>Examine the m-file, and try to understand how the\n",
    "simulation is performed.\n",

    "  1. Using the provided intermediate-delay simulation, find the ball's\n",
    "speed and energy at the time of release, in the default dimensionless\n",
    "units (or, equivalent to speed in units of $\\sqrt{a/g}\\ $and energy in\n",
    "units of $\\text{Mga}$. Then express these same quantities in SI units,\n",
    "for a typical adult. How much more energy would the ball be expected to\n",
    "gain if thrown by a person twice as heavy? (Hint: Try it in simulation,\n",
    "or look at how $M$ enters into the equations.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. Notice that the simulations performed in (a.) all end due to maximum\n",
    "torque-velocity limits. Find the parameter that makes this a limiting\n",
    "factor, and try changing it to see if it results in faster throws.\n",
    "Briefly explain the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. What happens to ball energy and release time when small and larger\n",
    "values of 0.2 and 1.0 are used? Examine the time over which the legs are\n",
    "extending, and the time for the arm. Try to explain why intermediate\n",
    "delays are better, by examining these times as well as the angle and\n",
    "angular velocity trajectories over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. Plot the ball's relative energy (normalizing for ball mass) as a\n",
    "function of dimensionless delay ranging from 0 to 1, and repeat this for\n",
    "ball masses of 0.04, 0.10, and 0.25 *M* body mass). How does the optimum\n",
    "delay time change with increasing ball mass? How does the relative work\n",
    "performed on the ball change with ball mass?\n",

    "$\\theta_{\\text{knee}}$, $\\theta_{\\text{elbow}}$, etc. Briefly describe\n",
    "how you would formulate the simulation using joint angle states. Note\n",
    "that the state-derivative equations yield ${\\ddot{y}}_{\\text{hip}}$ and\n",

    "    radius $r$, and is attached to a leg with angle $\\theta$ measured\n",

    "    where the origin is located at where the foot-ground contact point\n",
    "    would be when $\\theta = 0$.\n",

    "  1.  Find the pose Jacobian to describe the center-of-mass and segment\n",
    "    pose,\n",
    "    ${V_{Q} = \\left\\lbrack {\\dot{x}}_{Q},{\\dot{y}}_{Q},\\dot{\\theta} \\right\\rbrack}^{T}$.\n",
    "    First find the full position $\\left( x_{Q},y_{Q} \\right)$, and take\n",
    "    its time-derivative to find the Jacobian $J_{p}$, where\n",
    "    $V_{Q} = J_{p}\\dot{\\theta}$.\n",

    "  3.  Find the corresponding constraint Jacobian, such that\n",

    "3.  The provided `runanthrowalk2` demonstrates the \"anthropomorphic\"\n",
    "    walking model with human-like inertial properties (continuing the\n",
    "    previous assignment). Briefly explain the steps taken in the file to\n",
    "    compute ground reaction forces following a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.  Using the provided parameter studies as example, perform your own\n",
    "    study of any other parameter, and describe how different values\n",
    "    affect walking performance (e.g., speed, collision losses, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  2.  Examine the step-to-step eigenvalues and eigenvectors, which\n",
    "    describe stability of the system. Does the nominal simulation have\n",
    "    local asymptotic stability?\n",
    "\n",
    "  3.  Note that one of the eigenvalues is zero. The corresponding\n",
    "    eigenvector (say, $v_{\\text{zero}}$) represents a combination of\n",
    "    state perturbations $c \\cdot v_{\\text{zero}}$ (where $c$ is small)\n",
    "    that result in no error. Apply such a perturbation to the initial\n",
    "    condition, and demonstrate that there is no effect on the next\n",
    "    step's states. How is it possible for the states to be perturbed and\n",
    "    have no effect on the states? (Hint: There is an effect on time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  4.  The simulation runs forward in time (1 dimension) in state space,\n",
    "    and its trajectory intersects the Poincar√© section (ground contact\n",

    "    have, for the rimless wheel, and for the anthropomorphic model?\n",
    "    (Thus in principle the fixed point can be described in less than $N$\n",
    "    dimensional state space, related to (c.) above.)<br/><br/>\n",

    "4.  Suppose a rigid body trunk is to be added to the anthropomorphic\n",
    "    model, with a hinge joint attached to the hip. The trunk is to be\n",
    "    modeled as an inverted pendulum of length $l_{t}$, with a point mass\n",
    "    $m_{t}$ at the top, and an additional moment of inertia described a\n",
    "    radius of gyration $r_{\\text{gyrt}}$ about the hip. (The total\n",
    "    moment of inertia about the hip is therefore\n",
    "    $m_{t}\\left( l_{t}^{2} + r_{\\text{gyrt}}^{2} \\right)$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "  1.  Describe how the equations of motion could be implemented, using the\n",
    "    pose Jacobian method. Hint: One additional body segment, three\n",
    "    additional rows to pose Jacobian.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2.  Describe how the constraint Jacobian would be modified. Hint: Two\n",
    "    additional constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3.  Optional (advanced): Implement the anthropomorphic model with trunk,\n",
    "    and find and demonstrate a limit cycle. Hint: The search for a limit\n",
    "    cycle is made easier by starting with the model without trunk, and\n",
    "    then making an initial guess with the trunk starting at vertical\n",
    "    position. Use an artificially large $r_{\\text{gyrt}}$, which need\n",
    "    not be physically meaningful, so that the trunk is very slow to fall\n",
    "    over. Once a limit cycle is found, continuous methods may be used to\n",
    "    reduce the radius of gyration to zero."
